%Problem 5

x=[2 3 4 8 1 2 5 5 2 10 4 2];
%u vector
u=[x(:,1).' x(:,3).' x(:,5).' x(:,7).' x(:,9).' x(:,11).']
%v vector
v=[x(:,2).' x(:,4).' x(:,6).' x(:,8).' x(:,10).' x(:,12).']

%I dont remember going over something on the lines of an odds and even
%function to only give the odds and evens of a vector. only thing I could
%think of other than this was u=(1:2:10). but that would take from a
%vector.
